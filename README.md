# Digit-Recognisation-model
Built Digit Recognition Model uses machine learning to identify handwritten digits from 28x28 pixel images. Typically powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model detects patterns like edges and curves that differentiate digits. It is trained on labeled datasets, adjusting its internal parameters to minimize prediction errors.
